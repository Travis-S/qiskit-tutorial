    "\n",
    "There are eight choices of symbols that can be displayed for the three slots on the machine.  To uniquely select between them, we need $3=\\log_{2}(8)$ bits on information.  The quantum slot machine uses three different backends to generate the random bit strings of length three that select which symbol to show on the wheel:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simulator**\n",
    "Uses the local qasm simulator in Qiskit terra to pseudo-randomly generate bit strings from a single-shot of quantum circuit that consists of Hadamard gates on nine different qubits followed by measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ibmq_5_tenerife**\n",
    "Computes $300$ shots of a three-qubit variant of the same circuit used in the simulator.  This is because only the `ibmq_5_tenerife` allows for accessing the `memory` of the backend, as opposed to computing the counts for all the shots.  Although pre-computing random values is not ideal as an evil-doer may be able to read the numbers, on IBM Q devices, it is best to compute a lot of values at once and then cache them.  After running once, this selection will allow you to use the machine $100$ times.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ANU QRNG**\n",
    "The random numbers generated from the circuits used above suffer from the fact that unavoidable energy relaxation makes the lower bit-strings slightly more favorable than others.  As such, it would be preferable to find a platform that generates random numbers from the quantum ground state of a system.  Here we use the [Australia National University Quantum Random Number Generator](https://qrng.anu.edu.au/) that measures the random fluctuations of the vacuum state of a quantum oscillator."
